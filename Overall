🐧 Linux Directory Deep Dive for Pentesting & Security
/home • /etc • /var • /bin • /usr • /tmp • /opt • /run
📁 1. /home — User Home Directories

Stores personal user data, settings, SSH keys, and history.

Common Contents

Documents/

Downloads/

.ssh/ → SSH keys

.bash_history → command history

.config/

.local/share/

Pentesting Use

Steal SSH keys: ~/.ssh/id_rsa

Read command history for passwords

Check for saved API keys or tokens

Look for scripts or credentials in plaintext

Find sensitive downloads or notes

📁 2. /etc — System-Wide Configuration Files

The brain of the system: configs for services, users, auth, networking, and security.

Important Files
File	Purpose
/etc/passwd	User accounts, shells
/etc/shadow	Password hashes + aging
/etc/ssh/sshd_config	SSH security settings
/etc/sudoers	Privileges and sudo rules
/etc/crontab	Scheduled tasks
/etc/network/	Network configs
Pentesting Use

Dump password hashes for cracking

Find SSH misconfigurations (root login, weak auth)

Escalate via sudo misconfigs

Abuse writable cron files

Extract stored credentials

📁 3. /var — Variable, Changing System Data

Contains logs, temporary data, spooled jobs, web files, and databases.

Key Subdirectories
Directory	Purpose
/var/log/	Authentication logs, system logs
/var/www/	Web server files
/var/spool/cron/	Cron jobs waiting to run
/var/tmp/	Temp files surviving reboot
/var/lib/	Databases and service data
Pentesting Use

Analyze logs for credentials or errors

Upload web shells to /var/www

Escalate via cron job manipulation

Pull database files from /var/lib/mysql

Use /var/tmp for payload persistence

📁 4. /bin — Essential User Binaries

Contains critical commands required for basic system operation (used by all users).

Examples

ls

cp

mv

cat

chmod

grep

Pentesting Use

Understand what tools exist on the target

Detect restricted shells (missing commands)

Check for malicious binary replacement (PATH hijacks)

📁 5. /usr — User Applications & Software

Most user-installed software lives here.

Subdirectories

/usr/bin → user commands

/usr/sbin → admin commands

/usr/lib → libraries

/usr/share → documentation, icons, etc.

Pentesting Use

Enumerate installed programs

Look for outdated or vulnerable software

Check for hidden admin tools in /usr/sbin

📁 6. /tmp — Temporary Files (World-Writable)

Cleared at reboot; sticky-bit directory.

Pentesting Use

Upload malicious scripts

Privilege escalation if sticky bit misconfigured

Symlink attacks

Temporary file poisoning

Example permissions (normal):

drwxrwxrwt  /tmp

📁 7. /opt — Optional / Third-Party Software

Where custom or commercial apps get installed.

Pentesting Use

Look for apps storing configs or secrets

Credentials in config files

Outdated software ripe for exploitation

Web apps installed here

📁 8. /run — Runtime Data

Replaces old /var/run.

Contains:

PID files

Lock files

Unix sockets

Service runtime data

Pentesting Use

Access running service info

Hijack or interact with sockets

Check process ownership and permissions

🔥 Summary Table
Directory	Contains	Pentesting Value
/home	User files, keys, histories	Credential theft, recon
/etc	System configs	Hashes, sudo, SSH, cron
/var	Logs, web files, DBs	Web shells, logs, cron, data theft
/bin	Essential binaries	Command availability, PATH attacks
/usr	User software	Outdated software, tools
/tmp	Temp files	Escalation, uploads
/opt	Third-party apps	Secrets, misconfigs
/run	Runtime data	PIDs, sockets, service info
